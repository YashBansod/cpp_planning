# a-star

### Some Design Decisions
The graph structure was implemented using boost graph library. Nodes and Edges are user defined structures that are
stored in a std::vector. The graph was configured for bidirectional architecture.

The open nodes in the a-star algorithm are selected from a priority queue. Priority queue was constructed using 
**std::priority_queue**. It was configured to use a **std::deque** as its base container.

The code was written to allow a desired level of configurability. Run the code with -h/--help tag to know more.  
```
./a_star -h

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                               Print the help message
                                              
  -s [ --start_id ] arg (=1)                  Start node id as listed in the Nodes file
  -g [ --goal_id ] arg (=1)                   Goal node id as listed in the Nodes file
  -w [ --weight ] arg (=1)                    Weight assigned to heuristic
  -v [ --verbose ] [=arg(=1)] (=0)            Verbosity. Choose between 0, 1, 2 and 3
  -n [ --node_fp ] arg (=nodes.txt)           Relative/absolute path to the Nodes file
  -e [ --edge_fp ] arg (=edges.txt)           Relative/absolute path to the Edges file
  -p [ --path_fp ] arg (=path_output.txt)     Relative/absolute path to the Path output file
  -t [ --search_fp ] arg (=search_output.txt) Relative/absolute path to the Search output file
```

Also, the program can be compiled to use a heuristic from a list of heuristics defined in file [search.h](./search.h).  
Some examples of heuristics are: eu_dist_heuristic, man_dist_heuristic, zero_heuristic.  

### Run Instructions
**For Ubuntu:**  
```shell script
# open this directory
cd <path to this directory>

# view the CMakeLists.txt file of the sub-project
cat ./CMakeLists.txt

# make sure proper directories are included in the CMakeLists.txt file.
<use code editor of your preference to edit CMakeLists.txt>

# create a build directory
mkdir build

# open the build directory
cd build

# cmake the project in the build directory
cmake .. 

# make the cmake project
make -j4

# execute the generated executible file
./<executible file>
```

**For Windows:** I would recommend using an IDE that uses CMake for build process. Use the contents of the provided 
CMakeLists_Windows.txt file in the CMakeLists.txt file of your project generated by the IDE.
Example IDE: CLion by Jetbrains, Visual Studio etc.
